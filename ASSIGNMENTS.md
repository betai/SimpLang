# Assignment 1

Write a simple interpreter that interprets off the syntax tree.  Don't
optimize this interpreter - we will write much faster interpreters in
later exercises.

The interpreter is only expected to handle correct inputs correctly.
Incorrect programs may lead to arbitrary results, including crashes.

## Assignment 1.1

Write a lexical analyzer.  It reads a file as input and outputs one
line per token.  All whitespace in the input file is ignored, apart
from separating tokens that would otherwise be single tokens.

Each line in the output has two parts, separated by a space:

1. The type of token.  This can be `keyword`, `identifier`,
   `operator`, or `integer`.

2. The token itself.

Keywords are `let`, `and`, `in`, `if`, `then`, `else`, `recur`,
`loop`, `end`.  Operators are `(`, `)`, `=`, `&&`, `||`, `!`, `<`,
`==`, `+`, `*`, `-`.  Identifiers can contain only letters, digits,
and the underscore, but cannot start with a digit.  Integers are
sequences of digits.

The analyzer is not expected to handle incorrect input.

Example input:

    let a = 1 and
		loopy = a+-1
	in
		loopy
	end

Expected output:

    keyword let
	identifier a
	operator =
	integer 1
	keyword and
	identifier loopy
	operator =
	identifier a
	operator +
	operator -
	integer 1
	keyword in
	identifier loopy
	keyword end

Note that tokens need not be separated by spaces, like `a+-1` in the
example above, which is four separate tokens.  Also note that
identifiers can "contain" keywords, like `loopy` above, which is not
the keyword `loop` and the identifier `y`, but just one identifier.

More example inputs are in the `examples` folder.

## Assignment 1.2

Write a parser for `if` expressions.  The grammar to be recognized is
this (in [BNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backusâ€“Naur_Form)):

    expr = integer
         | "if" expr "then" expr "else" expr "end"


The output must show the structure of the input via indentation.  A
few examples:

Input:

    123

Output:

    123

Input:

    if 1 then 2 else 3 end

Output:

    if
      1
	  2
	  3

Input:

    if if 1 then 2 else 3 end then 4 else if 5 then 6 else 7 end end

Output:

    if
      if
	    1
	    2
		3
      4
	  if
	    5
	    6
		7

To work towards an interpreter and compiler it is beneficial to first
parse the input into an intermediate data structure (an
[abstract syntax tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree)),
and then generate the output from that tree, instead of generating the
output directly while parsing.

## Assignment 1.3

Write an interpreter for the integer and `if` expressions from
assignment 1.2.  An integer evaluates to its value.  An `if`
expression evaluates to its `else` expression if its condition
evaluates to zero, otherwise to its `then` expression.

Input:

    123

Output:

    123

Input:

	if 8 then 1 else 2 end

Output:

    1

Input:

	if 0 then 1 else 2 end

Output:

	2

Input:

	if
	  if 1 then 0 else 1 end
    then
	  123
    else
	  if 8 then 3 else 4 end
    end

Output:

	3

## Assignment 1.4

Extend the parser to recognize operators, without yet implementing
operator precedence.  For now we require that binary operator
expressions are always parenthesized.  The grammar is now:

    expr = integer
         | "if" expr "then" expr "else" expr "end"
		 | unop expr
		 | "(" expr binop expr ")"
    unop = "!" | "-"
	binop = "&&" | "||" | "<" | "==" | "+" | "*"

Input:

    if (1<2) then (3*4) else (5+!-if 7 then 8 else 9 end) end

Output:

    if
	  <
	    1
		2
	  *
	    3
		4
	  +
	    5
		!
		  -
		    if
		      7
			  8
			  9

Again, parse to an abstract syntax tree first, then generate the
output from the AST.  That will make the next assignment easier.

## Assignment 1.5

Extend the interpreter to handle the operators.  Note that all values
are 64 bit signed integers, using two's complement arithmetic.
Overflow is not handled, i.e. if it occurs, the result is whatever
fits into 64 bits.  In Python this can be implemented easily by using
the `numpy.int64` type.

Here's how the operators work:

* `!`_x_ is `1` if _x_ is `0`.  It's `0` if _x_ is not `0`.

* `-`_x_ is the arithmetic negation of _x_.

* _x_`&&`_y_ is `0` if either _x_ or _y_ are `0`, otherwise `1`.  Note that we will later need
  [short-circuit evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation),
  so if _x_ is `0`, don't evaluate _y_.

* _x_`||`_y_ is `0` if both _x_ and _y_ are `0`, otherwise `1`.
  Short-circuit evaluation applies here, too.

* _x_`<`_y_ is `1` if _x_ is less than _y_, otherwise `0`.

* _x_`==`_y_ is `1` if _x_ is equal to _y_, otherwise `0`.

* _x_`+`_y_ is the sum of _x_ and _y_.

* _x_`*`_y_ is the product of _x_ and _y_.

Input:

    (9223372036854775807+1)

Output:

    -9223372036854775808

Input:

	((9223372036854775807+1)*2)

Output:

	0

Input:

	((1 && 2) + (0 || 3))

Output:

	2

Input:

    !!123

Output:

	1

## Assignment 1.6

Extend the parser to parse `let` constructs, and to allow identifiers
as expressions.  The grammar is now:

	expr = integer
		 | ident
         | "if" expr "then" expr "else" expr "end"
		 | "let" bindings "in" expr "end"
		 | unop expr
		 | "(" expr binop expr ")"
	bindings = binding {"and" binding}
	binding = ident "=" expr
    unop = "!" | "-"
	binop = "&&" | "||" | "<" | "==" | "+" | "*"

## Assignment 1.7

Extend the interpreter to handle `let`.

Input:

    let a = 1 and
        b = (a + 1)
	in
	    (a + b)
	end

Output:

	3

Input:

	-let a = 31415
	in
		let a = 1 and
			a = (a + 1)
		in
			a
		end
	end

Output:

	-2

## Assignment 1.8

Extend the parser to recognize `loop` and `recur`.  The grammar is
now:

	expr = integer
		 | ident
         | "if" expr "then" expr "else" expr "end"
		 | ("let" | "loop") bindings "in" expr "end"
		 | "recur" arg {arg}
		 | unop expr
		 | "(" expr binop expr ")"
	bindings = binding {"and" binding}
	binding = ident "=" expr
	arg = "(" expr ")"
    unop = "!" | "-"
	binop = "&&" | "||" | "<" | "==" | "+" | "*"

## Assignment 1.9

Extend the interpreter to handle `loop` and `recur`.  Note that
running a loop must not consume more memory the more often it recurs.
For example:

    loop a = 100 and
		 b = 0
	in
	    if (a == 0) then
	        b
		else
			recur (a+-1) (b+1)
		end
	end

gives

    100

If instead `a` is initialized with `1000000` it must not use more
memory than, as above, with `100`.

The easiest way to achieve this, with a recursive interpreter, is to
let the interpretation function return either a result, or a value
that indicates that the innermost `loop` is to be rerun, including the
new values to be bound.

See the [README](README.md) on details of which positions `recur` can
be used in.

Input:

    loop n = 10 and
         fac = 1
	in
		if (n == 1) then
			fac
		else
			recur (n+-1) (fac*n)
		end
	end

Output:

	3628800
