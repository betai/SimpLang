# Assignment 1

Write a simple interpreter that interprets off the syntax tree.  Don't
optimize this interpreter - we will write much faster interpreters in
later exercises.

The interpreter is only expected to handle correct inputs correctly.
Incorrect programs may lead to arbitrary results, including crashes.
